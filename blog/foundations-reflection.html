                  your ego due to the Human Skills learning?

                I can do it, and I am capable. I know I have a lot of self doubt
                and coming into this course I was in a dark place. Learning more
                about how I learn and adding more tools to my arsenal to help me
                accomplish what I set out to do. A big part of my journey so far
                has been reflecting. Being forced to take the time and look back
                on what I have done and see the good, the bad and the ugly.
                Forcing myself to take a hard look at what I think I am and
                seeing the difference to what I actually am.

                One of my bigger discoveries is; My ego can be put aside. I
                might think of myself in a certain way but doing something
                completely new for the first time has reminded me its okay to
                learn and be bad and fail. I don't have to be the complete
                package yet, It's all about loving the process. That's what
                builds better systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am also a bit scared of things as well. More than I want to
                believe I am. That has been something human skills has shown me
                is okay and can be overcome. Taking moments to plan my learning,
                my wellness and to meditate really helps lock my mind in and
                feel more strong and help myself to do that which I find scary
                but will help me in the long-term.

                  What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
                  learning and programming?</strong

                They help to structure your mind. They guide you on your journey
                through the ups and downs for the process of learning and
                programming. The empathy you give both yourself and the work you
                do allows a healthy relationship of building knowledge and
                skills as well as giving you space to be human and grow. Whether
                that's through having a frustrating task stop you so you ask for
                help, Growing to be self-aware to not be blinded by pride and
                ask for that help. Or you find something that you thought was
                going to be challenging ends up to be easy and you can give
                yourself the space to be happy and see the journey you have been
                on. Being true to the values you hold and growing new ones along
                the way.

                Having time set to learn about myself and seek to reflect on how
                I work was a really wonderful process. Having to look at myself
                along side doing a whole new skill in programming helped me
                understand more about myself than I ever thought I would from
                this bootcamp. It is important to be kind to one another and
                it's an important skill for the world and workplace.

                Actually taking the time to reflect on myself. Seeing myself in
                new light was actually more tough than I originally thought it
                would be. Thinking on myself and my goals took up a lot of
                mental space but was challenging to turn my thoughts on to the
                page (or blog post in this case) It was rewarding skill to learn
                about.

                Because we are all human. Working together in life is super
                important and necessary to achieve things. Human skills is a
                helping hand for the workforce we are about to join. It's been a
                nice way to also interact with my fellow cohort in this online
                environment. Knowing that there are other people doing the exact
                same thing as I am is really comforting.

                No. I have gained so much from spending the time reflecting and
                thinking. It has helped me to code better and be a better human
                being. I have enjoyed it. Its a core part of a balanced learning
                experience.

                We had really tough challenges. I think being able to take a
                break and look at what we have done was help to the whole
                process of learning. Actually coding helps but after the really
                hard challenges it was nice to force myself to break and take
                time to see what I had done and analyse it. It was useful to the
                whole learning experience and I think if I was just programming
                the whole time I would be burnt out and sizzled by now. Not
                taking in the learning and instead just trying to make it
                through. I support human skills they are important to being
                human within every we do.
