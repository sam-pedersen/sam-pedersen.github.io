                <strong> REFLECTION </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I've just finished working on a small personal project. I have
                got it to a nice stage of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) .I
                created a small state guessing game. I have always liked
                geography and I love a good quiz so I thought a guessing style
                game with the 50 states of America as the topic would be a fun
                idea to work on. Using outlines of the states you have to guess
                which one it is. If guessed correctly the state flag will pop up
                and you will move on to the next one. Once you get all fifty you
                get secret reward.
              </p>
              <p><strong>What the process was like?</strong></p>
              <p>
                It was different! It made me feel all times of ways about my
                skills and my person, It was challenging in parts but really
                rewarding to see it up and running. I struggled for a bit with
                things but I was surprised at how much I could go back and look
                at my previous work and see the answers in those files. Working
                on a project from scratch felt quite daunting to begin with.
                Actually beginning to code was a bit of hurdle, But once the
                basic framework of my HTML, CSS and JS was down I felt like I
                could get into a flow. Working towards making my idea on paper
                become a real usable page.
              </p>
              <p><strong> What went well? </strong></p>
              <p>
                Once I got over the hurdle of starting I found putting the HTML
                frame for my site and adding in some style with CSS to be a very
                quick task. I was surprised at myself for being able to
                construct the code so quickly. Previous code I had done held the
                answers to a lot of my questions and helped to give me some
                guidance when coding my JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking at the Tic-tac-toe work and JS carnival work I was able
                to understand how to create a guessing function to check the
                users answer. Referring to my statelist array I could declare
                variables for the suer's guess and the correct answer. Using an
                If Else statement I was then able to check the answer and either
                give the flag of the state or a pop up telling them the right
                state. Here's a look at the code of the function I created for
                this:
              </p>
              <img
                src="images/functioncode.png"
                alt="functioncode"
                width="50%"
                height="50%"
              />
              <p>
                <strong> What did I find difficult?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I had some pretty complicated (for me maybe not others) JS
                functions. I used different methods of problem solving to tackle
                this, google bit of rubber ducky and asking a friend. Sometimes
                I was able to get the help and fix the problem but sometimes I
                just made the problem worse, sending myself down a dark spiral
                of 'what the fuck am I doing??' but after lots of trial and
                error, problem solving and google deep dives I was able to get
                it (mostly) to a working state product.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What would I do differently next time?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe next time I wont make a game, Still something interactive
                but maybe on a different scale. A car window wiper sim maybe?
                All in all I think I would give myself a bit more time to
                ideate, plan before beginning my code. Very happy with what I
                was able to achieve!
