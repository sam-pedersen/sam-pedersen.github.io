                Creating with code is fascinating world. All the parts work
                together to make an interact dream come true. HTML is key for
                your content and structure. Imagine you're making a soup, The
                HTML is your mirepoix, your meat, your bones, and anything big
                and chunky you want in there. Like soup HTML is the meat of your
                website. Its the words and pictures. Everything you need to
                inform people of what your website is and does.
              </p>

                The CSS is your herbs, spices, pastes and sauces that you want
                to add flavour and style to your soup. Flavours and styles is
                what CSS and herbs have in common. CSS is used to make things
                pop! Putting the right information, the right flavour in the
                right place. Without your CSS you have a page with words on a
                screen. Flavourless water with some meat and veggies (which
                admittedly would still be tasty but it is lacking that flavour
                PUNCH!)

                JavaScript is YOU! It's you using your equipment , the process
                of following instructions so that the soup is built with the
                functions of the recipe. Its knowing to use a low heat to toast
                your spices in oil. It is your trusty tasting spoon to know if
                you need add more salt. By using JavaScript to control how the
                user interacts with the webpage. It mirrors the way YOU interact
                with the equipment. IF you need to stir the pot you do, ELSE you
                would stop and add spice. JavaScript works in a similar way
                using arrays and loops to list things like a recipe lists steps.
                It creates functions and objects to do things on your webpage.
                It's the clicking buttons to do commands. Stir pot =thing
                happens - good soup , Click button =thing happens - good
                interactive website.

              <p>
                Control flow Control flow is the order in which your computer
                executes statements you have written. Control flow is running
                the lines of code from top to bottom. However there can be
                conditionals that change the flow and skip some code if needed.
                Enter Loops, a sequence of instructions for the code to
                continually repeat until a certain set condition is met.
              </p>
              <img src="loopsidea.png" alt="loops" />
              <p>
                Understand all that? No? Me to so I broke it down in my mind so
                you don't have to. A Loop is like a prep list. You have the
                tasks you need to complete, prioritising the most important ones
                first and going down. E.G:
              </p>
              <p>Bake Cookies</p>
              <p>Prep Veggies</p>
              <p>Make Mayo</p>
              <p>Prep Deli meats</p>
              <p>Cut Bread</p>
              <p>Clean Station</p>
              <p>
                You might not finish the cookies before you start prepping the
                veggies or making mayo, But you constantly check the list and
                tick off the things you have done. Once you have finished your
                list you can give yourself a high five and move on to service.
                Loops and the control flow work in a similar way. As the control
                flow reads the code it sees when you have a Loop in place. It
                will run the code again and again until a condition is met
                (you've finished a task on your prep list) once all the
                conditions and repetitions have been met you have achieve your
                outcome of finishing your list!
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope that helps make sense of a tricky topic of loops and
                control flow. I'm off to put dinner in the oven and maybe
                something else I need to check my loop and see what I need to
                do.

                DOM what is it? What does it mean for Web development and us?
                DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface that
                represents structured documents like HTML as a tree of objects.
                It defines how to access, manipulate, and modify document
                elements using scripting languages like JavaScript. Here's a
                tree of what DOM looks like:
              </p>
              <img src="DOM.png" alt="DOM tree" width="50%" height="50%" />
              <p>
                DOM is the tree in which we access flies and manipulate them.
                It's a digital file cabinet for your HTML and friends data.
                Organising your workflow in the DOM correctly is key to good
                workflow. Like any work station the optimal set up helps to
                achieve optimal results. The DOM is your work station,
                connecting you pens to your paper, your photos to frames.
                Everything is all under your DOM tree! If you wanted to get to a
                specific file in your file cabinet you would know its set up so
                the top draw is your photos(your blog folder) you would then
                open that and search for the file in that (blog folder) draw in
                the cabinet to access the file.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope this helps explain the cool way DOM helps us organise and
                create with code!

                  >Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and
                  objects.
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Arrays Think of arrays as lists. Imagine you have a list of
                fruits you need to pick up from the store:
              </p>

              <pre>
  <code>
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
//Each item in the list has a position, starting from 0. So, in our fruits array:
</code>
</pre>
              <p>
                To access an item in the array, you use its position (also
                called an index):
              </p>
              <p>"Apple" is at position 0.</p>
              <p>"Banana" is at position 1.</p>
              <p>"Cherry" is at position 2.</p>

              <p>Objects</p>
              <p>
                An object is more like a collection of key-values. Think of it
                as a way to group related information together under one name.
                Here's an example of an object representing one of our fruits
                with various properties:
              </p>

              <pre>
  <code>
let fruit = {
  name: "Apple",
  color: "Red",
  taste: "Sweet"
};
</code>
</pre>

              <p>In this fruit object:</p>

              <p>"name" is a key with the value "Apple".</p>
              <p>"color" is a key with the value "Red".</p>
              <p>"taste" is a key with the value "Sweet".</p>

              <p>
                The key differences in accessing data are that arrays use
                numerical indexes. Ideal for ordered collections where the
                position of each item matters. Where as objects access using
                named keys. Ideal for collections where each item has a unique
                identifier (key).Understanding the difference between arrays and
                objects is crucial because it helps you decide how to organize
                your data. Use arrays when you need an ordered list of items.
                Use objects when you need to group related data with unique
                identifiers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope this helps you understand the how we use and get data
                from arrays and objects. All useful all data all good!

                  Explain what <code>functions</code> are and why they are

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine you're learning to cook. You have a recipe for making a
                cake, which includes all the steps like mixing ingredients,
                baking the batter, and frosting the cake. Instead of writing out
                all these steps every time you want to make a cake, you could
                write them down once and refer to them whenever you need to bake
                a cake. This is similar to what functions do in development.
              </p>

              <p>
                A function is like a recipe step in code. It's a block of code
                that is reusable, designed to perform a task. You define a
                function once, and then you can use (or "call") it whenever you
                need it, without having to rewrite the same code over and over
                again
              </p>

              <p>
                Here's what a function that adds two numbers together would look
                like:
              </p>

              <pre><code> 
                functionaddNumbers(a, b) {
                returna + b;
              }</code></pre>

              <p>
                So with this cool little function how is it helpful? Well they
                are great tools that can be reused and help organize your code.
                Once you've written a function, you can use it as many times as
                you need without rewriting the code. This saves time and effort.
                Functions also help keep your code organized and easier to
                understand. Instead of a long list of instructions, you can
                break your code into manageable chunks.
              </p>

              <pre><code>functionmakeCake() {
                  mixIngredients();
                  bakeBatter();
                  frostCake();
                }
                
                functionmixIngredients() {
                  console.log("Mixing ingredients...");
                }
                
                functionbakeBatter() {
                  console.log("Baking the batter...");
                }
                
                functionfrostCake() {
                  console.log("Frosting the cake...");
                }
                
                makeCake();
                // Output:// Mixing ingredients...// Baking the batter...// Frosting the cake...
                </code></pre>

              <p>
                Functions are great! They allow you to avoid writing the same
                code multiple times, reducing errors and making your code easier
                to maintain.
              </p>

              <pre><code>functiongreet(name) { console.log("Hello, "+ name + "!"); } greet("Alice"); greet("Bob"); greet("Charlie"); // Output:// Hello, Alice!// Hello, Bob!// Hello, Charlie! 
                </code></pre>
              <p>
                Functions can help make you code look sleek and fly. They can
                hide complex details. Meaning you can focus on the bigger
                picture stuff. You can even use a function without knowing
                exactly how it works internally. Its coding magic
              </p>
              <p>
                functions are powerful tools in Web Development that help you
                write clean, code. They allow you to reuse code, organize your
                tasks, avoid repetition, and simplify complex problems. They
                simply can do it all!
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope this helps you understand the world of Javascript and
                code a bit better. I know im still learning and getting to grips
                with all of it and writing all of this down really helped me get
                a (small but good) grasp on whats going on!
