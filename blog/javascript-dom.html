                Creating with code is fascinating world. All the parts work
                together to make an interact dream come true. HTML is key for
                your content and structure. Imagine you're making a soup, The
                HTML is your mirepoix, your meat, your bones, and anything big
                and chunky you want in there. Like soup HTML is the meat of your
                website. Its the words and pictures. Everything you need to
                inform people of what your website is and does.

              <p>
                The CSS is your herbs, spices, pastes and sauces that you want
                to add flavour and style to your soup. Flavours and styles is
                what CSS and herbs have in common. CSS is used to make things
                pop! Putting the right information, the right flavour in the
                right place. Without your CSS you have a page with words on a
                screen. Flavourless water with some meat and veggies (which
                admittedly would still be tasty but it is lacking that flavour
                PUNCH!)

                JavaScript is YOU! It's you using your equipment , the process
                of following instructions so that the soup is built with the
                functions of the recipe. Its knowing to use a low heat to toast
                your spices in oil. It is your trusty tasting spoon to know if
                you need add more salt. By using JavaScript to control how the
                user interacts with the webpage. It mirrors the way YOU interact
                with the equipment. IF you need to stir the pot you do, ELSE you
                would stop and add spice. JavaScript works in a similar way
                using arrays and loops to list things like a recipe lists steps.
                It creates functions and objects to do things on your webpage.
                It's the clicking buttons to do commands. Stir pot =thing
                happens - good soup , Click button =thing happens - good
                interactive website.

                I like soups, and food! I also am coming to like coding. I hope
                you can understand how these two cool things relate!

                <strong> is EQ different to IQ?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                IQ (intelligence Quotient) measures cognitive intelligence and
                problem-solving abilities, EQ focuses on the understanding and
                management of ones emotions. Unlike IQ which remains relatively
                stable throughout a persons life. EQ can be developed and
                improved over time. High EQ can lead to better communication.
                Stress management, and success in personal and professional
                relationships.
              </p>

              <p>
                A balance between the two is essential for a all-round
                individual. Both Contributing to success in different aspects of
                life.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Why is EQ important?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                EQ is an important skill in your life that helps you build
                stronger relationships, succeed at work, and achieve goals you
                set either personal or career based. Having a connection to your
                feelings and understanding of how they affect you and the people
                around you will help turn your intentions into actions.

              <p>

                for life and assess your needs as well as others you can
                demonstrate respect for peers and yourself in all aspects of
                your life.
