                  Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.
                  Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that
                  decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the
                  decision now.</strong

                Whilst studying in Wellington I bought a bike to get myself
                around town from my flat to wherever I needed to go. I wanted to
                reduce my emissions and not contribute to the growing climate
                crisis we are faced with. I was sad that I was unable to bring
                my bike with me to Auckland, However I am on the hunt for one up
                here as I still think it was a great decision. Even with the
                wind and rain it was a freeing experience being able to
                physically get myself outside in the world. Great decision will
                do again.

                Where I grew up in wellington I had a close connection to nature
                as well as the city. I spent many days running around the
                forests and mountains as well as the city streets. I love the
                city of Wellington it made me the person I am today. I have a
                strong connection to the city it was the place that taught me to
                love, care, and respect nature, it provides so much to everyone
                and everything. This in-turn influenced my biggest values in
                life which is respect and care. All of this for the people,
                things, places and the work which I do. I grew up around
                Kitchens and restaurateurs so to me this is the pinnacle of
                caring and respecting everything you use, make and do. Family is
                so important to me. Both my actual blood family as well as my
                found family and friends. They all teach us so much about the
                world as well as ourselves at time. The most valuable resource
                people have is time so I like to spend doing things that matter
                to me.

                My strengths whilst studying was my dedication and trust in
                myself to get the task done. Finding ways to learn that work for
                me best. Asking the questions I needed to get a better
                explanation that I could digest and takeaway new ideas and
                thoughts from. Even when things are tough and I want to just
                throw my toys out, I am very good at staying calm and figuring
                out the problems I face with a fresh perspective or whatever is
                needed for the task at hand. Keeping myself on track even when
                my inner voice is telling me horrible things that just aren't
                true

                My Main limitation in all learning environments is my Dyslexia.
                Spelling and reading have been huge problems for me since high
                school. Coding is word based, Which is a good challenge for me.
                It also provides me with my biggest limitation on this learning
                journey. I have systems in place and routines to help combat
                this but sometimes mistakes slip through the cracks. It is an
                everyday challenge, but everyday I find new ways to be better
                and grow. I want to see myself push past this and get a career
                in the tech space. I don't want dyslexia to define my learning
                opportunities and career growth I am more than that and want to
                show people that.

                During my time studying film I directed a short film. While we
                where in the final stages of editing. My producer, editor and
                myself where spending long hours editing up the project.
                Constructing our sound design was a tricky task we had all been
                dreading. Navigating these sessions we had long hours of
                deliberating about each stage. With all three of us having
                different views on how to edit, we made sure to take time to
                describe out views and why or why not we should make a decision.
                Taking the time to try things out and be honest when they
                did/didn't work regardless of if it hurt our ego's about our own
                thoughts on the project. We all knew we wanted the best and if
                that meant that changes had to be made that meant some of my
                ideas where left on the cutting room floor I was okay with that,
                and vice versa with everyone else in the edit suites. Next
                project I would like to try setting some non-negotiables a thin
                framework for us to refer back to if we start to get off track
                of the idea we set out with we can refer back to the
                non-negotiables and see if we still hit those marks. If we do
                great, if we don't figure out how to get back on track as a
                team.
