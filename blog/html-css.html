      <h1>Padding, Margins, and Borders.</h1>
      <h2>Whats the Difference?</h2>
      <h4>14/06/24</h4>

      <p>Kia ora!</p>
      <p>
        Borders, Margins and Padding these are things found in a book, on A4
        writing paper from school. All physical frames for work to be stuck
        inside of, But they are also key elements of HTML and CSS, boxing in
        your important contents!
      </p>

      <p>Here's a visual guide of what the box looks like:</p>
      <img src="Screenshot 2024-06-15 160059.png" alt="cpbm" width="50%" height="50%" />
      <p>
        just like when you have to keep inside they lines when drawing, These
        three elements are key properties of style within HTML and CSS that help
        to keep your content secure. Lets work from the inside out.
      </p>
      <img src="contentpmb.png" alt="content" width="50%" height="50%" />
      <p>
        Content: This is the good stuff, the innermost part, everything that you
        have worked on and want to showcase to the world. We want to make sure
        that the user is able to see and access this hard work when they use
        your HTML page.
      </p>
      <img src="paddingpmb.png" alt="padding" width="50%" height="50%" />
      <p>
        Padding: This Element is the inner space between your beautiful Content
        and the next stage with in the box, your border. Padding can be used to
        adjust the sizes of boxes to give yourself more room to work with and to
        let that content to let it shine! 
        <img src="borderpmb.png" alt="border" width="50%" height="50%"/>
        <p>Border: This Element is the perimeter
        of your box. They can be hidden, invisible not even making a peep on
        your screen. Or they can be a thick bold line that stands out and makes
        itself know! This is a great tool to show the outline of your box! </p>
      </p>
      <img src="marginpmb.png" alt="margin" width="50%" height="50%" />
      <p>
        Margin: this Element is the space outside the box, everything that isn't
        within the border. You can use Margins in CSS to center elements (like
        your box that you have created) by changing the values of the
        surrounding space you can move it to suit your needs and have it work
        around your desired design.
      </p>
      <p>
        However Beware Margin Collapse, This often occurs when you have to items
        stack on top of each other the larger of the two margins will be shown
        and the smaller margin will collapse and treated as if it where set to
        zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Elements all work to help you design and create with HTML and CSS.
        Figuring out what to edit and what to move around is all part of the fun
        of creating. So I hope this helps you to understand the Difference and
        go on to enjoy the process!
