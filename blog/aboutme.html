          <p>Kia ora</p>
          <p>
            my name is Sam i was born and raised in Te-Whanganui-A-Tara but have
            relocated up to Tamaki Makaurau . Growing up I adored films, and video
            games. I had a fasciation with how they worked and always thought they
            people behind them where magicians. This led to a love of being creative
            in way shape or form. This lead me to study Creative Media Production at
            Massey, Learning all about Film and Game design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have spent 10 years working in Hospitality. I loved everything about
            it and still adore cooking and making food. However I wanted a change
            from the heat of the kitchen lifestyle. Talking with customers and old
            work friends led me to get interested in a world outside the kitchen
            This lead to a deep dive in the world of coding and web development
            which became something I wanted to get stuck into. Along came Dev
            Academy which I see as the perfect challenge to help kickstart myself
            into a new career.

          <p>
            I know the road will be hard but I'm so excited to get stuck in, meet
            all new people and bring my creative mind into a whole new world! </p>
