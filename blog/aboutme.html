                My name is Sam. I was born and raised in Te-Whanganui-A-Tara but
                have relocated up to Tamaki Makaurau. Growing up, I adored films
                and video games. I had a fascination with how they worked and
                always thought the people behind them were magicians. This led
                to a love of being creative in any way, shape, or form. This led
                me to study Creative Media Production at Massey, learning all
                about Film and Game design.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have spent 10 years working in Hospitality. I loved everything
                about it and still adore cooking and making food. However, I
                wanted a change from the heat of the kitchen lifestyle. Talking
                with customers and old work friends led me to get interested in
                a world outside the kitchen. This led to a deep dive into the
                world of coding and web development, which became something I
                wanted to get stuck into. Along came Dev Academy, which I see as
                the perfect challenge to help kickstart myself into a new
                career.

                I know the road will be hard, but I'm so excited to get stuck
                in, meet all new people, and bring my creative mind into a whole
                new world!
