                <strong> Neuroplasticity </strong>
              </p>
              <p>What is Neuroplasticity?</p>
              <p>
                Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt due
                to experience. It is an umbrella term referring to the brain's
                ability to change reorganize, or grow neural networks. This can
                involve functional changes due to brain damage or structural
                changes due to learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Breaking down the word Plasticity refers to the brain's
                malleability or ability to change; it does not imply the brain
                is in fact made of plastic nor plastic. Neuro refers to neurons,
                (crazy I know) the nerve cells that are the building blocks of
                the brain and nervous system. This means that neuroplasticity
                allows nerve cells to change or adjust.

              <p>These are the 10 Principles of Neuroplasticity</p>

                The brain is like a muscle. These 10 principles help to guide
                learning and understanding of your brain so you can best adapt
                and learn new interests. With the knowledge of how to work your
                brain, you can start working it out! Like how to get better at
                shooting a basketball you practice everyday, using that skill
                and improving it with timed intense trainings. Spending optimal
                time working out to get better. The same ideas and approach can
                be used for your brain. Using the 10 principles to inform you as
                you set out on your path to broaden your mind. Benefitting in e
                everyday life by understanding that small improvements help lead
                to bigger improvements over time.

                Neuroplasticity for my benefit is knowing that I can grasp
                topics and new knowledge but only by engaging myself within the
                topic. Working my brain out each day to get 1% better everyday.
                Having spent a lot of time growing up playing sport I know what
                it takes to get better at something. Knowing this I now feel
                that if I train hard and long enough I can rewire my brain to
                become a coding fanatic. Reading up on how neuroplasticity works
                I found that getting sufficient sleep and exercising can both
                help with increasing plasticity. These are two things that I
                have included into my learning plan so that I have a healthy
                lifestyle while I am taking on all this knowledge.

                <strong> Growth Mindset.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                A growth Mindset is a belief that you can develop your skills
                and talents through hard work, the right strategies, and
                guidance from others. The idea that through effort you can
                cultivate your basic qualities. Everyone can change and grow
                through experience and application.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be a life long learner you always have to be growing. The
                world is constantly changing everyday. Just because I started
                out a novice at coding, doesn't mean I will always be a novice.
                Being open to the idea of growth is sometimes simply the first
                step into mastering a topic. Studies have shown that a growth
                mindset has been proven to improve students performance. It is
                important to have growth mindset while doing this course to help
                achieve the goals I have set out for myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understanding these in conjunction with learning is a big thing
                for me. I've never been a great learner. That's what I used to
                think. But having completed a degree gave me a confidence boost
                I was sorely lacking in the academic department. I am aware that
                it is always possible to learn new things and learn more than
                what you ever thought your mind could do. I feel I have opened
                my mind to new options and pathways for myself. I see I can be
                more than what I thought.

              <p>
                >Also the book Atomic Habits is a really really good read, I
                highly recommend it
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong> Reflection </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
                learning plan and strategy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Applying a growth mindset to everyday life is a step I am going
                to try and make. I will aim to continue to practice
                self-reflection each day. Each day I will remind myself that if
                I fail that it is okay, remind myself to use it as a learning
                opportunity. I will embrace the chaos each and everyday. The
                knowledge that my mind can be worked on and turned into
                something completely new excites me.
              </p>
              <p>
                My daily routine is something I have crafted to help my mind
                gather and regroup each day. Getting to have some time outside
                and be physical really gives my mind a good break. Giving myself
                the recovery I need to mould myself into the person I want to
                be. I will endeavour to add more time to reflect and breathe in
                my daily routine.
