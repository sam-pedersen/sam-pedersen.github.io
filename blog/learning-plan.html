            <p><strong> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong></p>
              <p>My long term goal is to gain a new career in the world of technology, I want to be able to contribute to the world of technology. Hopefully that is in:
              - Web Development 
              - UX/UI Design and Development
              - CX Specialist 
              - Game Development
               After this course I'd like to gain an entry level/graduate position, learning and working with all the new changes that come and happen within the world. I want to be able to have a better work-life balance so I can spend time with the people that matter as well as giving my all to my career.</p>
             <p><strong> A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</strong></p>
              From my years in Hospo I know that I can work hard and work well in a team environment. I am at my best when i'm heads down in the thick of it. During my time at Massey I found comfort in spending hours in the library studying and working on my craft, enjoying the time spent learning new technologies always fascinates me. I come in to roadblocks when studying of times when reading, I stumble and find errors in my spelling and forget to read the task outline properly. I have tools in place to help me, Grammarly has been a lifesaver as well text-to-speech,  but sometimes even with all the help I still need to take the extra time to read things through, often stepping away for a bit and coming back with a fresh pair of eyes.
              <p><strong>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></p>
              <p>I want to work on my person to person skills, communicating myself properly within this team and being active in listening with everyone.</p> 
              <p><strong> A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</strong></p>
             <p> • I will be honest with myself and my peers about my abilities. I will try to be open about my workload, being careful not to overcommit making sure I do everything to the best standard I can. 
              • I will commit to making time to plan out my life with my study. Scheduling my time according to what tasks need doing and prioritising important ones, making time for life as well
              • I commit to working hard and smart. Working with others and comprising when needed. Always making sure to listen to peoples' needs. Working as part of a team
              • I commit to being on-time, showing up when people need me and being honest with my availability, finding comprise where I can.
              • I will communicate feedback when asked, providing thoughtful and constructive feedback. I will also be open to feedback and accepting of it.
              • I will do my own research and development to tackle my problems before I reach out to a facilitator for help.
              • I will have fun ! </p>
            <p><strong>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team?</strong></p>
             <p> I expect them to be patience with us. Being kind to one another and being human. To have a typical student teacher communication channel.</p>
              <p>• Questions to be welcomed within the learning environment.</p>
              <p>• Help to be there, making sure work is of a high calibre</p>
             <p> • Given room to try, fail and then succeed. Helping to reflect along the way.</p>
             <p> • Treated each other with respect. </p>
              
              <p><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</strong></p>
              <p>My time is now quite free, I am very flexible I will only have to pick up my partner from work when they have late evenings. But I will always be open if my situation changes</p>
